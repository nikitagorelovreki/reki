# Comprehensive Code Review and Refactoring Plan for Reki (CUIS)

## Overview

This document presents a comprehensive code review of the Reki project and provides a structured refactoring plan. The review is organized into three main phases:

1. System Design Review
2. Architecture Review
3. Code Quality Review

Each section includes an analysis of strengths and areas for improvement, followed by a prioritized refactoring plan broken down into actionable tasks.

## Implementation Strategy

The implementation of these refactoring tasks should follow these guidelines:

1. **Start with high-priority items**: Focus on automated testing, error handling, security, and database optimization first.
2. **Implement incrementally**: Break down large tasks into smaller, manageable chunks.
3. **Maintain backward compatibility**: Ensure that refactoring doesn't break existing functionality.
4. **Test thoroughly**: Each change should be accompanied by appropriate tests.
5. **Document changes**: Update documentation to reflect architectural and code changes.
6. **Review regularly**: Conduct code reviews for all changes to maintain quality.

## Conclusion

This refactoring plan provides a structured approach to improving the Reki (CUIS) codebase while maintaining its functionality. By addressing these issues in a prioritized manner, the project will become more maintainable, secure, and performant over time.

The backlog items are designed to be actionable and can be directly imported into a project management tool for tracking and assignment.
